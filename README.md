# IBMWatsonWithPython
Using IBM's voice recognition API with Python.

To enter your authentication, adjust the values in the dictionary in the blank_authen.json file, then change the name 
of that file to "authen.json". I use the json library to read files because why not. 


All credit for the phenomenal APIs you see used here goes to IBM.
